hi pls don't judge me based off this codebase omg its awful almost every single language/framework im using again after a year minimum (cries)

alright cool haffun


/backend contains any backend related code.

/backend/archive 
contains a list of stuff that I've used but then decided to move out of because it didn't support smtg I needed

/processingImages 
contains all the image processing (generating embeddings and dumping into pinecone)

/frontend 
might contain some redundant files, it has a whole bunch of other things too like the parser etc.
